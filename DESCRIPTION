Description: A logistic regression tree is a decision tree with logistic regressions at its leaves. A particular stochastic expectation maximization algorithm is used to draw a few good trees, that are then assessed via the user's criterion of choice among BIC / AIC / test set Gini. The formal development is given in a PhD chapter, see Ehrhardt (2019) <https://github.com/adimajo/manuscrit_these/releases/>.
